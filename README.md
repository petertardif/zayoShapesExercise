# Shapes Exercise in JavaScript

Hi David and thanks for allowing the opportunity to complete this challenge.  I made it as modular as I could utilizing JavaScript's classes and inheritance. I ran out of time, but would have liked to refactor the main Shape class to potentially include the printDimensions functions.

It will be fairly easy to create new shapes with this pattern.  The developer would only need to instantiate a new class for the new shape that extends the Shape class while adding the specific area formula for the shape and printing the dimensions.

## Challenge
Pick a language you are comfortable with to solve this problem

1. Application that creates shapes (square, triangle, circle, rectangle)
2. All shapes should be able to calculate their own area
rectangle (length * width)
triangle (1/2 base * height)
circle (pi * radius^2)
3. All shapes should be able to print their name
4. All shapes should be able to print their dimensions
5. Application should create all shapes then output: 
* name: square, dimensions: 4 x 4, area: 16
* name: rectangle, dimensions: 4 x 3, area: 12
* name: triangle, dimensions:  a3 x b4 x c5, area: 6
* name: circle, dimensions: radius: 3, area: 28.27

Evaluation:  
  - Code should Run without error.
  - Abstraction, reusability of code and coding patterns will be evaluated.
 
Tip: How easy would it be to add  20 new shapes to your code?
